Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) with Iris Dataset
This project demonstrates Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS), a dimensionality reduction technique, using the famous Iris dataset from scikit-learn. MDS is used here to reduce the dimensionality of the data and visualize it in 2D space while preserving pairwise distances between samples.

What Is Multi-Dimensional Scaling?
Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) is a statistical technique used to visualize the level of similarity or dissimilarity between high-dimensional data points by projecting them into a lower-dimensional space (usually 2D or 3D).

In this notebook:
- The Iris dataset is loaded and scaled using MinMaxScaler.
- MDS is applied to reduce the data to 2 dimensions.
- A scatter plot visualizes the transformed data, colored by species.
- The code is well documented using the Jupyter markups
